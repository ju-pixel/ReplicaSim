# ReplicaSim

**ReplicaSim** is a GPU-accelerated simulation tool written in Julia for performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of **artificial spin ice (ASI)** systems. It is designed to efficiently simulate multiple replicas in parallel, making it suitable for high-throughput data generation in computational nanomagnetism research.

This tool was developed as part of my MSc research project:  
**"Localized Control of Magnetization Reversal in Square Artificial Spin Ice"**  
_Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manitoba, 2024_
